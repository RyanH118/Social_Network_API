# Social_Network_API

## Description

I was motivated in this challenge to make a social network where you can create users, add friends, post thoughts, and add reactions. The goal I wanted to accomplish was to full CRUD for users and thoughts and I wanted a POST and DELETE for friends and reactions. I learned how to use mongoDB and mongoose to work with insomnia and also the similarities and differences in mongoDB and postgres. When using mongoDB you need controllers which act likes routes from postgres and for routes on mongo you use the functions from controllers and then create a route with the indivual functions.
